# Hospital Management System

This system contains 3 different users: Patients, Doctors & Admins

Each of these roles has a corresonding .txt file and class.

I have created a user abstract class for these 3 class roles, as well as a Utils, Appointments class and a User Interface.

For the .txt files:

- Patient has an auto generated 5-digit id starting with 1----
- Doctor has an auto generated 5-digit id starting with 2----
- Admin has an auto generated 5-digit id starting with 3----
- Appointment has an auto generated 5-digit id starting with 4----

**Press any key on any of the screens to return to the previous menu**

Key Notes:

I have assumed that once a user has been added to the system, they must book an appointment in order to be assigned a Doctor.
